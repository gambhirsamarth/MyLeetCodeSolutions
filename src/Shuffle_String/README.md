<h2><a href ="https://leetcode.com/problems/shuffle-string/description/"  target="_blank">1528. Shuffle String</a></h2>

<p>You are given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length. The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.

Return the shuffled string.</p>

<pre>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> "leetcode"
<strong>Explanation:</strong> As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling. </p>
</pre>

<pre>
<strong>Constraints:</strong>

s.length == indices.length == n
1 <= n <= 100
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
0 <= indices[i] < n
All values of indices are unique.
